# 🔐 GitLab HTTPS + GitHub SSH Access on macOS

This guide explains how to configure Git to use:
- 🔐 **HTTPS (PAT)** for GitLab
- 🔑 **SSH** for GitHub

---

## 🔒 Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitLab

1. Log into [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).
2. Go to **Profile → Edit Profile → Access Tokens**.
3. Fill out:
   - **Name**: e.g., `macbook-pat`
   - **Expiry date**: optional
   - **Scopes**: ✅ `read_repository`, ✅ `write_repository`, ✅ `api` (if needed)
4. Click **Create personal access token**.
5. **Copy and save** the token securely. You won’t be able to see it again!

## 📦 Step 2: Clone Your Repos Using the Right Protocol

- GitHub (SSH):

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
  ```

- GitLab (HTTPS):

  ```bash
  git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/your-repo.git
  ```

To verify which protocol your remote is using:

```bash
git remote -v
```

---

## 🔑 Step 3: Use macOS Keychain to Store GitLab PAT

To avoid entering your PAT every time:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

macOS will then store and autofill the PAT securely.

## 📁 Step 3B: Safely Manage credential.helper in Version-Controlled Configs

If your `.gitconfig` is tracked in Git (e.g., in dotfiles), do **not** include sensitive info like credential helpers in that file.

Instead, use a **local-only Git config override**:

1. Create a `~/.gitconfig.local` file with:

   ```ini
   [credential]
       helper = osxkeychain
   ```

2. In your `.gitconfig`, include it like this:

   ```ini
   [include]
       path = ~/.gitconfig.local
   ```

3. Be sure to **exclude `~/.gitconfig.local` from version control**:

   ```bash
   echo ".gitconfig.local" >> ~/.gitignore_global
   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
   ```

This way, secrets stay out of version-controlled configs.

## ⚙️ Step 4: SSH Config for GitHub (Optional but Recommended)

If you're using SSH for GitHub, configure which key to use:

1. Open or create your SSH config file:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/config
   ```

2. Add the following:

   ```ssh
   Host github.com
     HostName github.com
     User git
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
   ```

   > **📝 Note:**  
   > The `IdentityFile` must point to a **real SSH private key** on your system.  
   > You are responsible for generating the key and naming it appropriately.  
   > If unsure, generate one with:
   >
   > ```bash
   > ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github -C "your_email@example.com"
   > ```

3. Test your SSH connection to GitHub:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

---

## ✅ Final Notes

- Use **SSH for GitHub** and **HTTPS with PAT for GitLab** with no conflict.
- Git chooses the correct protocol based on each remote's URL.
- You can confirm everything is set correctly using:

  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```

You're now fully configured for secure access to both GitHub and GitLab!
